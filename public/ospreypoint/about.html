          <h3>Andy M. Denenberg</h3><br>
		<p>A seasoned entrepreneur, Andy has been leading innovative companies for over 20 years.  Andy is a technologist at heart with a passion for great design and simple, cost effective solutions.   In building both products and companies, Andy has learned that all outstanding companies start with superior products, but economic success comes from integrated operations.  To be financially successful and therefore in control of its own destiny, a company’s management needs to balance its attention and resources across all aspects of its business.  Aside from a great product, successful companies have inspired people, financial discipline, compelling marketing and are always focused on selling their unique value to well-paying customers.</p>
		
		<h3>Entrepreneurial Background</h3><br>

		<p><b>1988</b> - Andy founded Denmac Systems, a leading network engineering and integration firm that designs, builds, optimizes and secures network infrastructures for Fortune 1000 companies.</p>

		<p>In addition to its consulting business, Denmac created multiple products and technologies which were spun-off and licensed to third parties or run as separate businesses:</p>

		<p><b>1990</b> - Denmac developed a proprietary suite of protocol analysis technology that automated the process of troubleshooting Client-Server based computing architectures.</p>

		<p><b>1992</b> - Network Communications Corporation exclusively licensed the technology for use in their line of network probes.</p>

		<p><b>1996</b> - Denmac spun-off Geneva Software, a network management software company generating $10 million a year in revenue.  Geneva had two award winning flagship products, Trendata and Alertpage, and was a pioneer in the Service Level Management arena.</p>

		<p><b>1998</b> - PLATINUM Technology Inc. acquired Geneva Software. As a result of PLATINUM’s acquisition of Geneva, Andy served as Vice President responsible for PLATINUM's Network Management Lab until returning to Denmac.</p>

		<p><b>1999</b> - Denmac spun-off Upright Software, a developer of web-based application software that streamlines the business cycle of Professional Service Organizations. Upright grew to serve thousands of users in multiple countries before being sold to Outtask Inc. in 2001.</p>

		<p><b>2008</b> - After 20 years of continued revenue growth and profitability, Denmac Systems merged with Netrix, LLC

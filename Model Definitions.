Rather than create a new user table, follow David Miller example to extend the Devise user table

Some Devise helpers
before_filter :authenticate_user!
Tell devise to use :user map@
user_signed_in?
Checks whether there is an user signed in or not
current_user
Current signed in user (e.g. current_user.email would give you the e-mail of the current signed in user)
user_session
Session data available only to the user scope

Step 1.  Create Migration to extend the devise user with
first:string
last:string
address:string
city:string
facebook:string
comments:text
rails generate migration AddProfileInfoToUsers first:string last:string address:string city:string facebook:string comments:text

Step 2. Make the new attributes accessible in model - user.rb
# Setup accessible (or protected) attributes for your model
attr_accessible :email, .... add the following... :first, :last, :address, :city, :facebook, :comments 

Step 4. Create a profile_controller to access the user from the user model
rails generate controller profile 

Step 5. Set-up profile views, including forms to manage the user data

Step 6. Create route to views using...
resource :profile


if needed.  Use devise help to access the current-user, etc
